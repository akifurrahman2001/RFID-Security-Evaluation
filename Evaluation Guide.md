The focus of this project and analysis document is to understand and evaluate hardware-based security protocols, specifically looking at Side Channel Attacks and Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) in RFID systems.

The document is split into several parts:

1. **Analysis of Side Channel Attacks**:
   - An overview of what side channel attacks are and examples of information that enable such attacks.
   - Discussion on the nature (passive or active) of side channel attacks.

2. **Evaluation of a Security Protocol Using PUFs**:
   - Critical analysis of a proposed protocol for RFID tag authentication using PUFs.
   - Identification of potential security flaws outside the typical attack vectors like plaintext response and replay attacks.

3. **Practical Application with L0phtCrack**:
   - Setup and execution of a password auditing tool to test the strength of a password based on known user information.
   - Exploration of both dictionary and brute-force methods.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **L0phtCrack 7**: For conducting password strength audits.
- **Text Mechanic**: Used for generating combinations for dictionary attacks.

## Setup and Installation

No installation required for viewing the documents. However, if you wish to run similar audits or experiments as described in the assignment:

1. **L0phtCrack Installation**:
   - Download L0phtCrack from [L0phtCrack Official](https://l0phtcrack.gitlab.io).
   - Follow the installation guide provided on their official documentation.
